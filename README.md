# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The purpose of this project is to simulate the analysis of Kickstarter data.  The analysis is in service to a playwrite who is looking for insights on the best path to take in funding her play.
The Key insights we want to highlight in this analysis are the trends of successful campaigns and the trends of campaigns similar to the one our playwrite plans to start.
First it was determined by Category that theater kickstarters are very popular.  They have a lot successes but also a lot of failure.

Further more it was determined that plays had a very encouraging success rate having virtually twice the number of successes than failures.

Other interesting findings that can be potentially useful are the time of year most success campaigns begin
