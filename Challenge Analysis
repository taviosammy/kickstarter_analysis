#Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Purpose of Analysis
 This analysis is intented to provide insight for a playwrite on how different kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
 Regarding launch dates we sought to find any corelation between the outcome of a campaign(success,failure,canceled) and the time of year it was launched.
 Similarly we looked to see how campaigns performed based on the amount they were aiming to raise.
 
 ##Analysis and Challenges
 
 ###Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch date
 It was important to first identify the year each campaign launched by using the "date created" data that was available to us.
 Once we had that we were able to create a detailed table that could be filtered by "year" and the desired category we wanted to highlight.

 In this case we were highlighting theater campaigns.  This data was then used to create a line chart that displayed the number of outcomes on the y-axis against
 the month of year on the x-axis

 ###Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
 We opted to create ranges for goals to allow our finding to be more presentable.  We then needed to use a countifs formula to specify the criteria of our set ranges
 , the subcategory of plays and their outcomes.

 Once we got those results, we used them to determine the percentage of each type outcome against the sum of outcomes that fell under a paticular range. 
 We then created a line chart to showcase the outcomes of the campaigns based on the campaign goal set.

 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 Pertaining to the "Outcomes based on launch date analysis", the result were very straight forward however there were possiblities for confusion.  Knowing how 
 to let the table show the months of the year insteading of showing Quarters for example. 
 There was a little more challenge doing the analysis based on goals as the formula to count the outcomes was very long and had to be precise.  For example by simply leaving
 an equal sign off the range we were specifying, ('>1000' instead of '>=1000') the resulting line chart would look significantly different and the numbers would simply
 be incorrect. 
 
 ##Results
 -What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
 The month of May stands out as the time of year most successful theater campaigns are launched.  However when it comes to failed campaigns, there seems to be no prefered
 time of year to launch if you planned to be unsuccessful.
 
 -What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 Campaigns that set lower, more resaonable goals are more likely to suceed while setting too high a goal increases your chances of failure.  There does however seem to be a
 sweet spot between 35000 and 44900 that has more successful campaigns than failures.
 
 What are some limitations of this dataset?
