#Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Purpose of Analysis
 This analysis is intented to provide insight for a playwrite on how different kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
 Regarding launch dates we sought to find any corelation between the outcome of a campaign(success,failure,canceled) and the time of year it was launched.
 Similarly we looked to see how campaigns performed based on the amount they were aiming to raise.
 
 ##Analysis and Challenges
 
 ###Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch date
 It important to first identify the year each campaign launched by using the date created data that was available to us.
 Once we had that we were able to create a detailed table that could be filtered by year created and the desired category we wanted to highlight.
